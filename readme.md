**warning**: you might see ugly code

This is extends the [Deno](https://deno.land/) runtime by adding some new features:

- Create webview windows using [wry](https://github.com/tauri-apps/wry)
- Bidirectional communication between the deno app and the windows

- Deno app: test.js
- Webview app: index.html


This is just a poc atm, it will be eventually ported to https://github.com/astrodon/astrodon
